# GPlates Web Service

The **GPlates Web Service** is a part of the on-going GPlates project funded by [AuScope](https://www.auscope.org.au/).
The web service is built upon [pygplates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html).
It allows users to utilize the pygplates functionalities without installing pygplates locally.
Users can send HTTP requests to https://gws.gplates.org to get the reconstruction results back.
This enables pygplates functionalities in any programming languanges and on any operation systems.

The web serivce is also containerized(https://hub.docker.com/r/gplates/gws). Users can choose to deploy the [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) containers locally
to enhance performance and data security.

The GPlates Web Service is created and maintained by [EarthByte](https://www.earthbyte.org) group at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/).
