If you are using Python, you may want to check out our GPlates Web Service Python client at https://github.com/michaelchin/gwspy.

The code snippet below demonstrates how to reconstruct three locations back to 100Ma using "Muller2019" model. You need "gwspy" and "shapely" to run the code.

```python
  # pip install gwspy
  # pip install shapely
  import shapely
  from gwspy import PlateModel, reconstruct_shapely_points

  lats = [50, 10, 50]
  lons = [-100, 160, 100]
  points = [shapely.Point(x, y) for x, y in zip(lons, lats)]

  model = PlateModel("Muller2019")
  paleo_points = reconstruct_shapely_points(model, points, 100) # 100 Ma
  print(paleo_points)
```

Here is another example. The subduction zones and coastlines in the image below was plotted 
by [plot_subduction_zones.py](https://github.com/michaelchin/gwspy/blob/main/examples/plot_subduction_zones.py).
