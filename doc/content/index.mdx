The **GPlates Web Service** is a part of the on-going GPlates project funded by [AuScope](https://www.auscope.org.au/). 
Built upon powerful plate tectonic reconstruction engine [PyGPlates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html), 
the GPlates Web Serice allows users to access the pygplates' comprehensive functionalities without installing it on their computers locally. 
This will not only make the pygplates more accesible, but also allow users to access the latest and a wide range of plate tectonic reconstruction models.
Users can simply send HTTP requests to https://gws.gplates.org and the GPlates server will do the work and send the results back. 

Using HTTP protocal allows access to pygplates functionalities across various programming languages and operating systems.
Just imagine how impressive it would be to do plate tectonic reconstruction on your smart TV or digital watch. 
If your device has limited computing power, the GPlates Web Service is always the good choice.

The web serivce is containerized(https://hub.docker.com/r/gplates/gws). If users need to enhance performance and data security, 
they can choose to deploy the GPlates Web Service [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image on their own servers. 
You can find the detailed instructions at https://github.com/GPlates/gplates-web-service/blob/master/docker/README.md.
You are also welcome to contact us for assistance. 

The GPlates Web Service is created and maintained by [EarthByte](https://www.earthbyte.org) group at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/).

# Getting Started 

If you are using Python, check out our GPlates Web Service Python proxy at https://github.com/michaelchin/gplates-python-proxy#readme.
The proxy is a convenient client which enables users to access the GPlates Web Service more easily. 
Instead of sending HTTP requests, the proxy allows users to access the service with Python function calls.

If you are not using Python, the best starting point would be checking out the examples at https://gwsdoc.gplates.org/examples.

# EarthByte Group

[EarthByte](https://www.earthbyte.org) group is an internationally leading eGeoscience collaboration between several Australian Universities, 
international centres of excellence and industry partners. One of the fundamental aims of the EarthByte Group 
is geodata synthesis through space and time, assimilating the wealth of disparate geological and geophysical data 
into a four-dimensional Earth model including tectonics, geodynamics and surface processes. The EarthByte Group is 
pursuing open innovation via collaborative software development, high performance and distributed computing, 
“big data” analysis and by making open access digital data collections available to the community.
