The **GPlates Web Service** is a key component of the ongoing GPlates project, funded by [AuScope](https://www.auscope.org.au/). Built on the powerful plate tectonics reconstruction engine [PyGPlates](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html), this service allows users to access the full functionality of PyGPlates via Internet/HTTP protocol. By providing remote access to the latest plate tectonics reconstruction models in the Cloud, the GPlates Web Service makes these advanced plate tectonics reconstruction tools more accessible to a wider audience. Users can simply send HTTP requests to https://gws.gplates.org, and the server will process the request and return the results. Using HTTP protocol allows access to PyGPlates functionalities in various programming languages and across different operating systems.

The web serivce is containerized(https://hub.docker.com/r/gplates/gws). Users can choose to deploy the service on their own servers/personal computers if they need enhanced performance and data security. The instructions of how to setup On-Prem hosting can be found at https://gwsdoc.gplates.org/on-prem-hosting.

The GPlates Web Service is created and maintained by [EarthByte](https://www.earthbyte.org) group at the [University of Sydney](https://www.sydney.edu.au/).

The main server(https://gws.gplates.org) is provided by [NCI](https://nci.org.au/) under AuScope scheme.

# Getting Started 

If you prefer writing programs in Python, you may want to check out the GPlates Web Service Python wrapper at https://github.com/michaelchin/gwspy/blob/main/README.md. The convenient Python client enables Python programmers to access the GPlates Web Service more easily. Instead of dealing with HTTP requests directly, the Python wrapper allows users to access the service with Python function calls.

If you prefer other programming languages, the best starting point is the examples at https://gwsdoc.gplates.org/examples.

# Demos with D3.js Maps

These web pages demonstrates how the GPlates Web Service can be used with JavaScript to develop web applications.

# EarthByte Group

[EarthByte](https://www.earthbyte.org) group is an internationally leading eGeoscience collaboration between several Australian Universities,international centres of excellence and industry partners. One of the fundamental aims of the EarthByte Group is geodata synthesis through space and time, assimilating the wealth of disparate geological and geophysical data into a four-dimensional Earth model including tectonics, geodynamics and surface processes. The EarthByte Group is pursuing open innovation via collaborative software development, high performance and distributed computing, “big data” analysis and by making open access digital data collections available to the community.
