## Use Docker Container To Deploy GPlates Web Service

The GPlates team has prepared a [Docker](https://www.docker.com/) image for users to deploy the GPlates Web Service on their own servers/personal computers. 
Running the GPlates Web Service locally inside a Docker container is especially important in the following scenarios:

* User requires short response time and low latency.
* User has a large volume of data to process and can provide much more computational power than GPlates server.
* User has security concerns about sending their data to a remote server.
* User cannot access service via Internet or the quality of the Internet connection is very poor.

The GPlates Web Service Docker container can be downloaded from Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/r/gplates/gws. 

To start a GPlates Web Service server, it can be as simple as the one-line command below.

```shell
docker run -d --rm -p 18000:80 gplates/gws
```

Click this [link](http://localhost:18000/reconstruct/reconstruct_points/?points=95,54,142,-33&time=140) to verify the service is working.
