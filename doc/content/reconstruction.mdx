The 'reconstruct' functions provide the basic reconstruction functionality familiar from the GPlates GUI. 
These include the ability to 

* return standard reconstructed features (e.g. coastlines, isochrons, tectonic block outlines) from one of the reconstruction models available from the web service)
* reconstruct point coordinates provided as part of the http request
* generate features that track the reconstructed motion of plates through time
