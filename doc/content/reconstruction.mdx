The ***reconstruction*** functions provide the basic reconstruction functionalities which are similar to 
[GPlates desktop](https://www.gplates.org) and [pygpaltes](https://www.gplates.org/docs/pygplates/index.html). 

These functionalities include the abilities:
* return standard reconstructed features (e.g. coastlines, isochrons, tectonic block outlines) from one of the reconstruction models available from the web service)
* reconstruct location coordinates provided as part of the http request
* generate features that track the reconstructed motion of plates through time
