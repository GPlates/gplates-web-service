The topology functions can be used with a subset of the available reconstruction models, 
specifically those that are constructed following the 'continuously closing plates' methodology made 
possible within the GPlates GUI. The returned plate configurations can be returned either as polygons, 
or as boundary segments with different boundary types (subduction zone, mid-ocean ridge) defined.
