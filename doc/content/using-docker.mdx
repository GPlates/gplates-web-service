## Use Docker Container for deployment

The GPlates team has prepared a Docker image for users to deploy the GPlates Web Service on their own servers. 
Running the GPlates Web Service locally inside a Docker container is especially important in the following scenarios:

* User's program requires short response time and low latency.
* User has a large volume of data to process and can provide much more computational power than GPlates server.
* User has security concerns about sending their data to a remote server.
* User cannot access service via Internet or the quality of the Internet connection is very poor.

The GPlates Web Service Docker container can be downloaded from Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/r/gplates/gws. 

```shell
docker pull gplates/gws:latest
```
