Run Reconstruction Service In A Docker Container
The GPlates team has prepared a Docker container for users to run the service in their own computers. Running the GPlates Web Service locally inside a Docker container is especially important in the following scenarios:

* User's program requires short response time and low latency.
* User has a large volume of data to process and can provide much more computational power than GPlates server.
* User has concerns about sending their data to a remote server.
* User cannot access internet service all the time or the internet service is very poor.

The GPlates Web Service Docker container can be downloaded from Docker Hub https://hub.docker.com/r/gplates/gws.
